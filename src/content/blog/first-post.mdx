## From Buzzword to Business Critical

For years, "AI" has been a topic of discussion in pharma boardrooms. Now, it's a reality on the factory floor and in the QA lab. This post explores the tangible impact of AI on compliance.

### The Challenge: A Sea of Data

Modern pharmaceutical manufacturing generates an enormous amount of data. From batch records to audit trails, ensuring data integrity (DI) and responding to regulatory bodies like the FDA is a monumental task.

- **Manual reviews are slow and error-prone.**
- **Response times to FDA 483s can stretch for weeks.**
- **SOPs become outdated and inconsistent.**
