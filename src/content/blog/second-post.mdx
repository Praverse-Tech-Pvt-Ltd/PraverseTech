## The Emergency Room Bottleneck

Anyone who has visited a hospital knows the frustration of waiting. The initial triage process is critical but often slow and manual. This is where HealthMate comes in.

### More Than Just a Check-in

HealthMate is not a simple check-in screen. It's a sophisticated diagnostic assistant.

1.  **Vitals Capture:** Integrated sensors capture temperature, blood pressure, and SpO2.
2.  **Symptom Understanding:** Patients can speak or type their symptoms in natural language. Our NLP model understands context and asks clarifying questions.
3.  **EHR Integration:** The collected data is structured and pushed directly into your existing Electronic Health Record system.

### A Real-World Example

```javascript
const patientData = {
  vitals: {
    temp: '38.5C',
    bp: '140/90',
    spo2: '96%',
  },
  symptoms: 'I have a bad cough and my chest hurts when I breathe.',
  triageScore: 8, // AI-generated urgency score
  recommendedAction: 'Immediate review by nurse practitioner.'
};
```

This structured output allows clinical staff to prioritize patients effectively, leading to better outcomes and a more efficient workflow.
